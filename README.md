Enumerating Binary Strings Without K-Runs of Ones
=================================================

Implementations of the enumeration algorithm for counting numbers of N-long binary strings without K-runs of ones.

See [my blog post](http://blog.jtcho.me/enumerating-binary-strings-without-k-runs-of-ones) for a detailed explanation of the algorithm and the intuition behind it. :)
